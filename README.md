# debug-camperbot-profile-page
This is a freeCodeCamp project. It's a part of the Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum.

User Stories:

    1. Camperbot is trying to use a heading2 element, but that element does not exist. Fix those tags so it uses a correct second-level heading element.
    2. Camperbot is trying to add two paragraphs with pp, but those don't exist either. Fix them so they use correct paragraph tags.
    3. Camperbot is using an h3 element for the Background and Interests subheading but it has a syntax error. Spot the issue and resolve it.
